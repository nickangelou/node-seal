# node-seal

This is a library wrapper for the Web Assembly port of the C++ Microsoft SEAL library.

It contains high level functions to make using this library easy. There are default parameters
which can be customized and overridden for advanced use cases.

Source will be posted on a public repository in the future with 
plans on also releasing the C++ fork from Microsoft SEAL to generate
the Web Assembly.

# Microsoft SEAL

Microsoft SEAL is an easy-to-use homomorphic encryption library developed by researchers in 
the Cryptography Research group at Microsoft Research. Microsoft SEAL is written in modern 
standard C++ and has no external dependencies, making it easy to compile and run in many 
different environments.

For more information about the Microsoft SEAL project, see [http://sealcrypto.org](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/microsoft-seal).

# License

Microsoft SEAL (and `node-seal`) are licensed under the MIT license.

# Installation

npm:
```
npm install node-seal
```

yarn:
```
yarn install node-seal
```

At this time, the library is not available on a CDN. This is a TODO.

# Caveats

Our goal is to allow client-side and server-side Javascript to use a well established
homomorphic library. However, there will be several limitations due to transitions from 
C++ to Javascript.

Limitations:

- Dealing with 2^53 numbers (not true 64 bit). 
  JS Arrays may infer the wrong type definition for the elements inside.
  For consistent results, use a TypedArray.
  
- Generating large keys and saving them in the browser could be problematic.
  We can control NodeJS heap size, but not inside a user's browser. 
  
  Saving keys is very memory intensive especially for `computationLevel`s above low. 
  This is because there's currently no way (that we have found) to use streams 
  across JS and WASM, so the strings have to be buffered completely in RAM and 
  they can be very, very large. This holds especially true for `GaloisKeys`.
  
- Using this library in client frontend maybe difficult to integrate.
  If you use webpack, it will need to be tweaked. 
  Please refer to the webpack configuration in this library.
  
- Performance is less than the C++ native library despite being converted to Web Assembly. 
  This is mainly due to poorly optimized SIMD, random number generator, 
  slow memory allocations, etc. We have not benchmarked them directly, but the slowdown
  is noticeable.
  
- By default, we encrypt/decrypt arrays (typed) of data. If you're encrypting a single
  integer (Int32/UInt32) you will receive back a TypedArray of length 1 containing the 
  decrypted result. We do this because we _want_ to have batching mode enabled for both 
  `BFV` and `CKKS` schemes.
  
- If you specify a JS Array with JS Numbers and the elements are greater than the bounds 
  of an Int32/UInt32, the data will be treated as a C++ 'double' and may cause undesirable
  results. __Why?__ For users who want to get started with both Scheme Types 
  with some small test data before optimizing.
  
- While initializing the library asynchronous, the core is synchronous and will block the main 
 thread. For now, we advise to put this library in a NodeJS `child_process` or browser 
 `Web Workers` and writing the necessary adapter logic.

# Usage

There are a lot of assumptions made to help ease the burden of learning 
SEAL all at once. You can refer to the sample code below.

For those who are curious about the security of Microsoft SEAL, please
refer to [HomomorphicEncryption.org](http://homomorphicencryption.org/)

## Basics

There are two __Scheme Types__ that SEAL supports:
- `BFV` operates on Int32/UInt32
- `CKKS` operates on JS Float (Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)

`BFV` is used to encrypt/decrypt on real integers whereas `CKKS` is used for floats.
However, the main difference really is in how `CKKS` delivers an _approximate_ result 
back to you. Ex. A decrypted `CKKS` cipher may be a few decimals off depending on 
several factors. If 100% accuracy is needed, use `BFV`. 

There are several __Keys__ in SEAL:
- `PublicKey` used to encrypt data
- `SecretKey` used to decrypt data
- `RelinKeys` used to extend the number of homomorphic evaluations on a given cipher
- `GaloisKeys` used to perform matrix rotations on a cipher

Currently, this library only supports the generation of `RelinKeys` and `GaloisKeys`. 
At this time, the idea is to generate these keys and share them with a 3rd party where
they could be used in an untrusted execution environment. You may also share the `PublicKey`
as the name implies. This allows 3rd parties to perform homomorphic evaluations on the
ciphers that were encrypted by the `SecretKey`. Never share your `SecretKey` unless you _want_
others to decrypt the data.

##### Note on homomorphic evaluations:
Microsoft SEAL is not a fully homomorphic encryption library and as such, encrypted ciphers 
have a limit on the total number of evaluations performed before decryption fails. When designing a 
leveled homomorphic algorithm, you can test the limits to see where decryption fails and where
you can increase the `computationLevel` or manually tweak the parameters.

Steps:
1. Import the library
2. Create encryption parameters and initialize the context 
   (sets the library to work in a given constraint of parameters)
3. Create or load previously generated public/secret keys
4. Create some data to encrypt. Save it, send it to a 3rd party for evaluation, or evaluate locally
5. Decrypt the encrypted cipher result

## Example

CommonJS
```
(async () => {
  // Due to limitations with how the WASM file is loaded, 
  // we need to await on the main library in order to have
  // a fully instanciated instance. This limitation mostly
  // because of how chrome limits the size of synchronously
  // loaded WASM files. Therefore, loading must be done 
  // asynchronously.

  // If loading in the browser, this line is not needed.
  const { Seal } = require('node-seal')
  const Crypt = await Seal
  
  // There are 3 different computationLevel's that have been predefined
  // for ease of use. 'low', 'medium', and 'high'. The computation levels
  // allow for more homomorphic operations __on__ encrypted cipherText's
  // at the cost of more CPU/memory.
  //
  // Security is by default 128 bits, but can be changed to 192 or 256 bits again 
  // at the cost of more CPU/memory.
  //
  // The computation level and security settings that you choose 
  // here limit the total number of elements in an array as well
  // as their min/max values.
  
  const parms = Crypt.createParams({computationLevel: 'low', security: 128})
  
  // BFV schemeType allows for pure Integer arithmetic
  Crypt.initialize({...parms, schemeType: 'BFV'})
  
  // Generate public and secret keys
  Crypt.genKeys()
  
  // Save the keys so we don't have to generate them again
  // They will be base64 strings
  const publicKey = Crypt.savePublicKey()
  const secretKey = Crypt.saveSecretKey()
  
  // You can skip `Crypt.genKeys()` by loading them instead 
  Crypt.loadPublicKey({encoded: publicKey})
  Crypt.loadSecretKey({encoded: secretKey})
  
  // Create some values in an array. Note the limitations of the array 
  // size, and value size
  const step = parms.plainModulus / parms.polyDegree
  
  // Could be a regular JS array or a TypedArray
  const value = Int32Array.from([1, 2, 3])
  
  // Encrypt the data
  // We auto detect the 'type' for JS Arrays, but if the hint is specified we will convert it
  // TypedArrays will set the type automatically.
  const oldCipherText = Crypt.encrypt({value})
  
  // You can save the cipherText for later as a base64 string
  const savedRawCipher = oldCipherText.save()
  
  // And reload it later using the helper
  const cipherText = Crypt.reviveCipher({encoded: savedRawCipher})
  
  // Createt a copy to sum later
  const cipherText2 = Crypt.reviveCipher({encoded: savedRawCipher})
  
  // But you will need to reinitialize some values. It would be best
  // to also serialize this data in combination with the raw cipherText
  // so that you may retrieve all the related information in one go.
  cipherText.setSchemeType({scheme: oldCipherText.getSchemeType()})
  cipherText.setVectorSize({size: oldCipherText.getVectorSize()})
  cipherText.setVectorType({type: oldCipherText.getVectorType()})
  cipherText2.setSchemeType({scheme: oldCipherText.getSchemeType()})
  cipherText2.setVectorSize({size: oldCipherText.getVectorSize()})
  cipherText2.setVectorType({type: oldCipherText.getVectorType()})

  // Send the encrypted data to a 3rd party for 
  // homomorphic operations. But we need more
  // metadata of the cipherText to help  
  // facilitate homomorphic operations involving
  // optional matrix rotations, etc.
  const cipherObject = {
    cipherText: cipherText.save(), // gets the base64 string representation of the cipher
    schemeType: cipherText.getSchemeType(),
    vector: {
      size: cipherText.getVectorSize(),
      type: cipherText.getVectorType(),
    }
  }
  
  const resultCipher = Crypt.add({a: cipherText, b: cipherText2})
  
  // Decrypt the result which returns a TypedArray
  const resultInt32Array = Crypt.decrypt({cipherText: resultCipher})
  
  console.log('resultInt32Array', resultInt32Array)
  // resultInt32Array Int32Array(3)Â [2, 4, 6]
  
})()

```

# Testing

You can find the list of tests in `package.json`. They can be useful to see different
parameters and how they affect execution time. Some of the tests will
take a long time to complete and consume a lot of memory.
