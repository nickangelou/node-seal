     * @description
     * Provides functionality for CRT batching. If the polynomial modulus degree is N, and
     * the PlainText modulus is a prime number T such that T is congruent to 1 modulo 2N,
     * then BatchEncoder allows the PlainText elements to be viewed as 2-by-(N/2)
     * matrices of integers modulo T. Homomorphic operations performed on such encrypted
     * matrices are applied coefficient (slot) wise, enabling powerful SIMD functionality
     * for computations that are vectorizable. This functionality is often called "batching"
     * in the homomorphic encryption literature.
     *
     * @par Mathematical Background
     * Mathematically speaking, if the polynomial modulus is X^N+1, N is a power of two, and
     * PlainModulus is a prime number T such that 2N divides T-1, then integers modulo T
     * contain a primitive 2N-th root of unity and the polynomial X^N+1 splits into n distinct
     * linear factors as X^N+1 = (X-a_1)*...*(X-a_N) mod T, where the constants a1, ..., a_n
     * are all the distinct primitive 2N-th roots of unity in integers modulo T. The Chinese
     * Remainder Theorem (CRT) states that the PlainText space Z_T[X]/(X^N+1) in this case is
     * isomorphic (as an algebra) to the N-fold direct product of fields Z_T. The isomorphism
     * is easy to compute explicitly in both directions, which is what this class does.
     * Furthermore, the Galois group of the extension is (Z/2NZ)* ~= Z/2Z x Z/(N/2) whose
     * action on the primitive roots of unity is easy to describe. Since the batching slots
     * correspond 1-to-1 to the primitive roots of unity, applying Galois automorphisms on the
     * PlainText act by permuting the slots. By applying generators of the two cyclic
     * subgroups of the Galois group, we can effectively view the PlainText as a 2-by-(N/2)
     * matrix, and enable cyclic row rotations, and column rotations (row swaps).
     *
     * @par Valid Parameters
     * Whether batching can be used depends on whether the PlainText modulus has been chosen
     * appropriately. Thus, to construct a BatchEncoder the user must provide an instance
     * of Context such that its associated EncryptionParameterQualifiers object has the
     * flags parametersSet and enableBatching set to true.

     * modulus, this is the ring where the arithmetic operations will take place.
     * BatchEncoder (batching) provider an alternative possibly more convenient view
     * of the PlainText elements as 2-by-(N2/2) matrices of integers modulo the PlainText

     * element-wise. Some of the operations only apply in the batching view, such as
     * matrix row and column rotations. Other operations such as relinearization have
     * no semantic meaning but are necessary for performance reasons.

     * @par Arithmetic Operations
     * The core operations are arithmetic operations, in particular multiplication

     * several CipherTexts for convenience. in many cases some of the inputs to a
     * computation are PlainText elements rather than CipherTexts. For this we
     * provide fast "plain" operations: plain addition, plain subtraction, and plain
     * multiplication.
     *
     * @par Relinearization
     * One of the most important non-arithmetic operations is relinearization, which
     * takes as input a CipherText of size K+1 and relinearization keys (at least K-1
     * keys are needed), and changes the size of the CipherText down to 2 (minimum size).
     * For most use-cases only one relinearization key suffices, in which case
     * relinearization should be performed after every multiplication. Homomorphic
     * multiplication of CipherTexts of size K+1 and L+1 outputs a CipherText of size
     * K+L+1, and the computational cost of multiplication is proportional to K*L.
     * Plain multiplication and addition operations of any type do not change the
     * size. Relinearization requires relinearization keys to have been generated.
     *
     * @par Rotations
     * When batching is enabled, we provide operations for rotating the PlainText matrix
     * rows cyclically left or right, and for rotating the columns (swapping the rows).
     * Rotations require Galois keys to have been generated.
     *
     * @par Other Operations
     * We also provide operations for transforming CipherTexts to NTT form and back,
     * and for transforming PlainText polynomials to NTT form. These can be used in
     * a very fast plain multiplication variant, that assumes the inputs to be in NTT
     * form. Since the NTT has to be done in any case in plain multiplication, this
     * function can be used when e.g. one PlainText input is used in several plain
     * multiplication, and transforming it several times would not make sense.
     *
     * @par NTT form
     * When using the BFV scheme (SchemeType.BFV), all PlainTexts and CipherTexts
     * should remain by default in the usual coefficient representation, i.e., not
     * in NTT form. When using the CKKS scheme (SchemeType.CKKS), all PlainTexts
     * and CipherTexts should remain by default in NTT form. We call these scheme-
     * specific NTT states the "default NTT form". Some functions, such as add, work
     * even if the inputs are not in the default state, but others, such as multiply,
     * will throw an exception. The output of all evaluation functions will be in
     * the same state as the input(s), with the exception of the transformToNtt
     * and transformFromNtt functions, which change the state. Ideally, unless these
     * two functions are called, all other functions should "just work".

     * @description
     * Manages a shared pointer to a memory pool. Microsoft SEAL uses memory pools
     * for improved performance due to the large number of memory allocations
     * needed by the homomorphic encryption operations, and the underlying polynomial
     * arithmetic. The library automatically creates a shared global memory pool
     * that is used for all dynamic allocations by default, and the user can
     * optionally create any number of custom memory pools to be used instead.
     *
     * @par Uses in Multi-Threaded Applications
     * Sometimes the user might want to use specific memory pools for dynamic
     * allocations in certain functions. For example, in heavily multi-threaded
     * applications allocating concurrently from a shared memory pool might lead
     * to significant performance issues due to thread contention. For these cases
     * Microsoft SEAL provides overloads of the functions that take a MemoryPoolHandle
     * as an additional argument, and uses the associated memory pool for all dynamic
     * allocations inside the function. Whenever these functions are called, the
     * user can then simply pass a thread-local MemoryPoolHandle to be used.
     *
     * @par Thread-Unsafe Memory Pools
     * While memory pools are by default thread-safe, in some cases it suffices
     * to have a memory pool be thread-unsafe. To get a little extra performance,
     * the user can optionally create such thread-unsafe memory pools and use them
     * just as they would use thread-safe memory pools.
     *
     * @par Initialized and Uninitialized Handles
     * A MemoryPoolHandle has to be set to point either to the global memory pool,
     * or to a new memory pool. If this is not done, the MemoryPoolHandle is
     * said to be uninitialized, and cannot be used. Initialization simple means
     * assigning MemoryPoolHandle.Global() or MemoryPoolHandle.New() to it.
     *
     * @par Managing Lifetime
     * Internally, the MemoryPoolHandle wraps an std::shared_ptr pointing to
     * a memory pool class. Thus, as long as a MemoryPoolHandle pointing to
     * a particular memory pool exists, the pool stays alive. Classes such as
     * Evaluator and CipherText store their own local copies of a MemoryPoolHandle
     * to guarantee that the pool stays alive as long as the managing object
     * itself stays alive. The global memory pool is implemented as a global
     * std::shared_ptr to a memory pool class, and is thus expected to stay
     * alive for the entire duration of the program execution. Note that it can
     * be problematic to create other global objects that use the memory pool
     * e.g. in their constructor, as one would have to ensure the initialization
     * order of these global variables to be correct (i.e. global memory pool
     * first).

     *
     * @par Memory Management
     * The coefficient count of a PlainText refers to the number of word-size

     * word-size coefficients that fit in the current memory allocation. In high-

     *
     * When the scheme is SchemeType.BFV each coefficient of a PlainText is a 64-bit
     * word, but when the scheme is SchemeType.CKKS the PlainText is by default
     * stored in an NTT transformed form with respect to each of the primes in the

     * @par Relinearization
     * Freshly encrypted CipherTexts have a size of 2, and multiplying CipherTexts
     * of sizes K and L results in a CipherText of size K+L-1. Unfortunately, this
     * growth in size slows down further multiplications and increases noise growth.
     * Relinearization is an operation that has no semantic meaning, but it reduces
     * the size of CipherTexts back to 2. Microsoft SEAL can only relinearize size 3
     * CipherTexts back to size 2, so if the CipherTexts grow larger than size 3,
     * there is no way to reduce their size. Relinearization requires an instance of
     * RelinKeys to be created by the secret key owner and to be shared with the
     * evaluator. Note that plain multiplication is fundamentally different from
     * normal multiplication and does not result in CipherText size growth.
     *
     * @par When to Relinearize
     * Typically, one should always relinearize after each multiplications. However,
     * in some cases relinearization should be postponed as late as possible due to
     * its computational cost. For example, suppose the computation involves several
     * homomorphic multiplications followed by a sum of the results. In this case it
     * makes sense to not relinearize each product, but instead add them first and
     * only then relinearize the sum. This is particularly important when using the
     * CKKS scheme, where relinearization is much more computationally costly than
     * multiplications and additions.
