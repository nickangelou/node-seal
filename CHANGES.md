# List of Changes

## Version 2.0.0

### Features
This version includes a core update to version 3.3.0 of Microsoft SEAL in web assembly. 

### API Changes

There is now an exposed low level API in web assembly which can be found in [src/lib/Seal.js](src/lib/Seal.js).
This can be used by more advanced users who wish to be as close to the original library as 
possible without much abstraction.

See [Microsoft's Change log](https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL/blob/master/Changes.md) for more details.
